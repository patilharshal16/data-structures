## Stack (Last In First Out)
[Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:
* Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
* Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

## Queue (First In First Out)
[Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence. By convention, the end of the sequence at which elements are added is called the back, tail, or rear of the queue, and the end at which elements are removed is called the head or front of the queue, analogously to the words used when people line up to wait for goods or services.
